# 4. IT WON’T HELP INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS

## What the NO case says

- It won’t help indigenous Australians.
- ...more bureaucracy is not the answer.
- A centralised Voice risks overlooking the needs of regional and remote communities.
- Right now, many voices are crying out for help... What’s needed is action.
- What we need in Canberra is ears, not a Voice.


## My thoughts

### It won’t help indigenous Australians

This statement is (negative) speculation. I believe that we can "close the gap" for indigenous
Australians if we want to. This probably requires several things to achieve success, such as:

- problem solving skills; the voice would contribute to this process
- good communication between parties involved; the voice would contribute to this process
- good will and good intent on the part of the parties involved
- competent work


### More bureaucracy is not the answer

None of us love bureaucracy, however
the federal and state governments are themselves a bureaucracy. Unfortunately, you cannot easily
"talk" to the government (and they cannot easily "listen") unless there are processes and procedures
in place for doing so. The voice would establish such a process.


### What we need in Canberra is ears, not a Voice

See above section *More bureaucracy is not the answer*.


### A centralised Voice risks overlooking the needs of regional and remote communities

The Voice Principles (reference 3) says, "The Voice would consult with grassroots communities
and regional entities to ensure its representations are informed by their experience, including
the experience of those who have been historically excluded from participation".


### Right now, many voices are crying out for help... What’s needed is action

True!

However, I think this is like saying "I don't want you to waste time planning and
designing my house, or paying attention to safety standards -- I just want you to
take action and build it."

What we are talking about here is how the government can take measures to "close the gap".
This includes breaking a cycle of poverty, poor education, poor health, poor employment
prospects and so on.

So what does *action* mean in this context?

I suspect it is not usually simple. I think that for each issue the approach is likely to be something like:

1. Identify the problem
1. Consider various ways of solving the problem
1. Choose the "best" solution (although best is frequently a subjective term)
1. Implement the solution. For government, this may include:
   - pass legislation
   - allocate funding
   - allocate and direct resources to perform the work

I feel The Voice is likely to make a significant contribution to the first 3 of these steps.
