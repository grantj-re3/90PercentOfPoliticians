# 3. IT DIVIDES US

## What the NO case says

- This Voice will not unite us, it will divide us by race.
- This goes against a key principle of our democratic system, that all Australians are equal before the law.


## My thoughts

### I believe we are already divided

In my view we are already divided. First Nations people too often suffer disadvantage compared to the general
population regarding:

- education
- employment
- health and life span
- poverty

The purpose of the Voice is to help address this disadvantage by allowing First Nations people to have a
say in matters which affect them.


### I believe the central reasoning is not about race

In my view, this is not about race. This is about attempting to address a problem of disadvantage of a group of
people (who happen to be of a different race) where the root cause of the disadvantage is a history of
systemic failure (to put it mildly) by successive British and Australian governments over centuries and decades.

So why should we single out this group rather than other races or other disadvantaged groups?

Not because of their race, but because:

- they occupied this country first
- they were displaced from their own country without any agreement, contract, etc.
- worse still, successive governments have felt the need to control the lives of First Nations people
  with little consultation with those people (although this may have improved in recent decades)

**If this group was the same race as me**, but with the same history and the same resulting disadvantage,
then I think **allowing them to have a Voice would also be a good idea**.

I feel this is a good step towards addressing past injustices which has resulted in a modern day
cycle of poverty, etc. for too many First Nations people.


### Equality before the law

I do not believe that allowing a group to "make representations to the Parliament and the Executive Government"
impacts equality. There are already many lobby groups giving advice to Parliament and government. This
is just another one. Parliament and the Executive Government can ignore the representations if they choose (but
hopefully they will carefully consider them).

However, let's examine what this NO-argument is saying.

I agree with the principle of equality, but I feel you need to apply it at all times and not just 
ignore it when it doesn't suit you.

When the Britsh arrived in Australia, they already had a justice system in place and an understanding of rights
as given in the Magna Carta. The Magna Carta included things like:

- no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law
- a method to handle lands unlawfully taken from the Welsh by the English

and yet:

- they came to Australia
- they deprived many First Nations people of life, liberty, or property/land
- they colonised the country without any agreement, contract, etc. with First Nations people
- decades later the Australian constitution was written without regard to First Nations people

This NO-argument is asking us to ignore history and consider equality where the
*starting point* is after the Australian constitution was written. It is asking
us to ignore *equality before the law* for a major series of events, despite
the fact that British/Australian authorities already had a justice system and an
understanding that these actions were not giving First Nations people the same/equal
rights compared to British citizens or white Australians.

I feel **this NO-argument is being too selective about where we apply equality and where we choose to ignore it**!

You might think that these events occurred a long time ago, so should be ignored now. However I feel
that First Nation people are living with the consequences of this today.
