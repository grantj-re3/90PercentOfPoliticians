# If you don't know...

I'm not very keen on "arguments" for YES or NO which rely on fear, advertising slogans, chanting, or similar.

I would prefer to listen to facts, information, expert opinion and the opinion of those who are most likely
to be impacted.

We all have biases, and media and other publications are likely to have biases even if they are unintended. So
how can we arrive at a good decision regarding the Voice to Parliament referendum? I have some suggestions.

1. Try to keep an open mind before forming an opinion.

1. Try to find reputable sources of information. In other words:
   - Ignore publications with content based on fear, slogans, non-expert views, etc. unless they are
     supported by reliable information.
   - Read/watch publications with balanced content if possible. If they are difficult to find, then
     read/watch a mix of content both for and against the YES vote.

1. Try to put yourself in the postion of the groups who this will affect most, in particular First Nations people.

1. Try to remember that people and laws and law makers are not perfect and so voting YES or NO is not likely
   to result in a perfect system. I like to think in terms of "Are we heading in the right direction?"

1. After spending time doing the above things, try to form a view which is fair.


## Ideas about finding info

I recommend you find your own sources of information. If you can, then it will be easier to satisfy
yourself that you were less influenced by those who aren't experts in the area, or aren't First Nations
people or aren't working closely with First Nations people. In my view, good sources of information
would include:

- those who understand the constitution and the law
- reliable accounts of Australian history
- universities
- First Nations people and those who work with them

Less reliable sources of information may include:
- social media
- radio and TV "personalities"
- politians

unless they are backing up their views with solid information or evidence, or they are experts in
a related field.

All of these contain their own biases. My selection of these contain my biases. Feel free to find your

   - The [VOICEfacts videos](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/voice/voicefacts/voice-facts-1st-series/voicefacts-videos)
     are short (often 30-40 second) answers to specific questions about the voice.
   - You can pick which of the 32 public VOICEfacts videos you want to watch, or you can use
     [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOObpoQndRmwcXPvddSgZWKBt4ewtBJF) to
     watch them all in sequence. I imagine you can watch the whole playlist in about 20 minutes on x1.5.

   4.  How can the Voice represent the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander views?
   5.  Is the Voice in breach of international human rights standards?
   6.  Donâ€™t Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people already have lots of â€˜voicesâ€™ to government and parliament?

   - Full disclosure: This is a bunch of links which I found in Feb 2023.
   - I have already made up my own view by reading these links.
   - If you read these you inevitably get my biases (even though I tried to select articles from reputable sources).
   - There is quite a lot of information, so you are likely to spend many hours if you read it all.

   - This is an official document, but in my view it is an **unreliable source of information** because of
     how the content was prepared. The AEC web page says:
     "... the AEC was not involved in the development of the content of the Yes and No cases. Each case was prepared and authorised by parliamentarians who voted for and against the proposed law and the AECâ€™s legal obligation was to accept and distribute each case as it was submitted."
