## Possible solutions

1. [Alison Vivian et al. | Indigneous Self-Government in the Australian Federation | 2017](http://www.ilc.unsw.edu.au/sites/ilc.unsw.edu.au/files/AILR_20_Vivian_et_al.pdf)
   - Research over a 30-year period by the Harvard Project on American
     Indian Economic Development (‘Harvard Project’) finds that the defining
     characteristic common to thriving North American Native nations is collective
     self-determination, manifest in Indigenous communities or nations having
     decision-making control over their internal affairs
   - Indigenous peoples do not conceive of themselves as mere stakeholders or
     minority groups. Instead they expect to be acknowledged and respected as
     separate and distinct polities within the boundaries of the nation-state.
   - Despite cumulative
     policies of dispossession, assimilation, marginalisation and paternalism,
     Indigenous peoples around the world have ‘retained a sense of their
     distinctiveness as a political community’ and consider their ‘claim to a separate
     autonomous status as all-pervasive and lying beneath nearly all their claims.’
     Indigenous peoples throughout the world seek self-government to pursue their
     own social, economic, cultural and political goals
   - The many Aboriginal nations and communities with which we have worked
     do not seek secession, nor do they seek to exercise general jurisdiction over non-
     Indigenous people. In the Australian context, they are at once citizens of
     Australia and citizens of their respective Indigenous nations or members of their
     respective Indigenous communities. We have heard many people describe
     themselves as ‘dual citizens’...
   - ... we have frequently heard... the refrain that Indigenous peoples have never
     ceded their sovereignty or right to self-determination.
   - ... the problem of how states deal with ‘nations within’ is not a marginal issue: it is
     one of the key issues, perhaps even the central issue, for states in the 21st
     century.  Attempting to reconcile colonial myth with reality is always complicated for
     colonial states
   - ... scholars have
     noted that some features of federalism also provide a promising framework for
     accommodating the self-governing aspirations of Indigenous peoples.
   - In Australia, are such features enough to accommodate Indigenous
     governments as part of a 21st century Australian federation? There are signs...
     that the answer is a qualified ‘yes’...
   - Whether a federal system truly can accommodate such differences in origins is an open question.
   - Still more lessons relevant to the inclusion of Indigenous governments in the
     Australian federation can be drawn from developments in the status of local
     government
   - Our objective here is simply to observe that contemporary and evolving
     understandings of lawful authority and of the nature of federation can provide
     Indigenous peoples and the Australian state with a theoretical basis for
     Indigenous governments to be ‘seen’ by the Australian State.
   - ... the conversation must engage with the illegitimacy of a sole and
     exclusive settler State sovereignty...  A genuine reframing necessarily envisions:
     free and equal peoples on the same continent [who] can mutually recognise the
     autonomy or sovereignty of each other in certain spheres and share jurisdictions in
     others without incorporation or subordination.

   - We should not overlook the fact that Aboriginal people are also grossly
     over-represented as victims of crime... Why is it so?
     ... disadvantage and discrimination.
   - ...why these problems have proven to be so intractable
     despite decades of effort by people of good will... The
     general approach has usually been for non-Aboriginal policy makers and
     administrators to approach these issues as if they are their problem, to be
     resolved by the non-Aboriginal policy makers. The reality is that these
     are problems for the Aboriginal community concerned, and which can
     only be effectively solved by that community. Once that proposition is
     accepted, the proper role of non-Aboriginal policy makers and
     administrators is to empower and resource Aboriginal communities to
     derive their own solutions to these problems.
   - A good start would be genuine collaboration with
     Aboriginal people. They might not tell us what we want to hear and they
     will not speak with one voice. But they can help us identify what needs
     to be done...
   - Progress is being made, and will continue to be made if people of good
     will take a sensible and constructive approach to the empowerment of
     Aboriginal people and the resolution of the ethical dilemmas...
