# 2. THERE ARE NO DETAILS

## What the NO case says

- We don’t know how it will help disadvantaged communities and close the gap.
- These details would only be worked through after Australians have voted... This is the wrong way around.
- You wouldn’t buy a house without inspecting it or a car without test driving it.
- Yet you are being asked to vote to change our Constitution without details.
- Australians shouldn’t be asked to sign a blank cheque


## My thoughts

### How changes are made to the constitution

I understand the way the law works in Australia is this:

- High level principles are written in the constitution.
- A referendum is required if you wish to make a change to the constitution.
- The details relating to the principles are legislated by parliament.

Since the referendum is about adding something to the constitution, then this vote is about high level principles.
Or to put it another way, the Prime Minister and others need to be careful not to give excessive detail about
what they *prefer*, because if their preferences are not passed by parliament then they would be misleading
the public.


### What details are available?

Given the limitations described above, I think there is a reasonable amount of detail available regarding The Voice.

Good sources of information include:

- Voice Principles (reference 4 below): This is a short and easy to read summary
- Indigenous Voice Co-design Process Final Report (reference 3 below): This is a 272 page PDF report with
  a great deal of detail


### These details would only be worked through after Australians have voted... This is the wrong way around

I feel there is some merit to this argument, however:

- This is how the law works in Australia for constitutional changes. The politicians who wrote the above text know this.
- In my experience for most large projects/programs, the high level decisions are typically made first then the details follow.
  I feel this is common practice in business and in other areas.
- There is also great merit in agreeing to a high level framework first, then work out the details which fit within the framework.
- The details will almost certainly change over the years and decades whereas the high level principles in the
  constitution will remain constant (unless they are changed with another referendum).


### You wouldn’t buy a house without inspecting it or a car without test driving it

In my view, this referendum is not the same as an individual buying a house or a car. I think this is more like a business, club
or community group having a meeting to decide if it would be beneficial to the business or group to purchase a tractor or other
tool or machinery. Once the meeting has approved the decision [similar to a YES vote in the referendum] they can ask some employee
or committee member to report back about cost, features and other details [similar to proposed legislation by parliament].


### We don’t know how it will help disadvantaged communities and close the gap

I feel this is about stakeholder consultation. It is about giving First Nations people a say on matters which affect them.

Links about how stakeholder consultation improves outcomes are given below.

- The OECD web page (reference 5) says "The 2021 Regulatory Policy Outlook... shares good regulatory practices that can help *close the gaps*".
  The chapter 2 PDF is about Evidence-based policy making and *stakeholder engagement* in order to achieve this.
- The Policy Consultation & the Importance of Stakeholders page (reference 6) has a section *Why Stakeholders Matter for Policy Making*.
  It says "without effective stakeholder engagement and consultation, it’s much harder and riskier to design and implement good policies".
